This is my q1 pre-exam.

1. setup production environment (sass, jade, javascript, jasmine specs), and a deployable environment, and gulp tasks to bridge the two.

2. start cranking stories on pivotal tracker. (stories tagged by module)

3. upon finishing each module, deploy to firebase, PR on modules repo

__What I've learned so far__

* how to npm normalize into sass

* more gulp tasks

  * gulp-image

  * gulp-sass objects
