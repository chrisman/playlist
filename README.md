# Playlist/Track bin

This is my q1 pre-exam.

1. setup production environment (sass, jade, javascript, jasmine specs), and a deployable environment, and gulp tasks to bridge the two.

2. start cranking stories on pivotal tracker. (stories tagged by module)

3. upon finishing each module, deploy to firebase, PR on modules repo

__What I've learned so far__

* how to npm normalize into sass

* more gulp tasks

  * gulp-image

  * gulp-sass objects

* jade templates!

* flexbox thumbnail positioning! `display: flexbox; direction: column; justify-content: space-between;`

* async is killing me. i wanted almost all of my api logic to be in a module, but i couldn't get it to load the way I wanted it to, and I couldn't get the scoping right either. I ended up bailing out after having dumped way too much time into it, and just coding everything hard into the static js files. no modules, no tdd :(
